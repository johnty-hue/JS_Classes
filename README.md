# Classes and Objects

classes are a blueprint of objects
They help us to declare objects that mimic real-life objects

to create a class in Js
*syntax:*

class **name** {

    - constructors
    - propereties
    - methods
    
}

name is the name of that class
<hr/>

Objects are instances of classes and they have properties.
For example is a *blue* **chair**

The chair is the object with a *blue* **color** property
